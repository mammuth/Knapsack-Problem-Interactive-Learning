# Knapsack-Problem-Interactive-Learning
Small Webapp which let's user try to solve the Knapsack problem via easy drag'n'drop and presents the correct solution as well. 

Maybe something like this might be used in educational use in computer-science lessons. 

Done as part of a seminar at Technische Universität München. 
 
 
##### Demo
There is a demo hosted [here](http://maxi-muth.de/files/knapsack/), however probably it's not always up-to-date to this repo, because the mirror on maxi-muth.de just for demo purposes.

Just clone the Repo and open the index.html file to check it out!
