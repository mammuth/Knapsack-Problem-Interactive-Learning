# Knapsack-Problem-Interactive-Learning
Small Webapp which let's user try to solve the Knapsack problem via easy drag'n'drop and presents the correct solution as well. 

Maybe something like this might be used in educational use in computer-science lessons. 

Done as part of a seminar at Technische Universität München.
